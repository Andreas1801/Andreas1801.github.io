# My favourite character: Asterix, der Gallier

Asterix is a fictional character and the titular hero of the French comic book series Asterix.

The series portrays him as a diminutive but fearless Gaulish warrior living in the time of Julius Caesar's Gallic Wars. 

Asterix was created in 1959 by writer René Goscinny and illustrator Albert Uderzo. Since then, thirty-five books in the series have been released, with Uderzo taking over writing duties after the death of Goscinny in 1977. 

Asterix has also appeared in several animated and live-action film adaptations of the series, and serves as the mascot of the amusement park Parc Astérix. 
Before that, he was also the mascot of the magazine Pilote.
